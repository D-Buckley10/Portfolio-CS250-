# Sprint-Retrospective-Review

Question 1: **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

  I believe that one of the best methods for interpreting user needs and how they will be implemented would be creating user stories. User stories are a way to gather statements from the client about what changes or features need to be implemented in the product. User stories also assist in determining the amount of work a project will need as well as the size of project. 
  
Quesiton 2: **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

  One necessary component of developing programs is to have a plan outlined for the project. When it comes to coding specifically, this is where pseudocode can come into play. Pseudocode is a form of outline for a program, and if done correctly should allow for easy implementation. Agile allows for the development process to look for new ways to improve the efficiency of the process both for the sake of the team and for the benefit of the owner/company. Some of the processes that I would like to incorporate into my future development would be to draft up user stories and use Kanban boards as a way to track progress.
  
Question 3: **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

  This question has a lot of correct answers, but I would have to say the two most qualifying features in a "good team member" would be a team member who communicates openly and is respectfully to all other members of the team. For communication, the team member should be capable of clearly stating what he/she has been able to contribute towards the completion of the project. As for the respect aspect, I believe that a great team member should be able to encourage the other members and listen to other opinions while providing constructive criticism without offending or belittling the other team members. In a scrum team, the development team are seen as a group of professionals that are needed to implement the changes into the software. Members of this team are all seen as equals, each person just a essential as the next and each of them needing the ability to copenly communicate any problems so that they may be resolved as soon as possible.
